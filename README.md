# HuffmanCoding
## Description and Assumptions
After running the makefile using the command ``make``, you can compress and uncompress arbitrary input files using the Huffman Encoding compression. This program assumes that the characters in the input file comes from the ASCII characters.
## Usage
```
./compress <original_file> <compressed_file>
./uncompress <compressed_file> <uncompressed_file>
```
